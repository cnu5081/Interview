"Just talk to me about your GCP experience."
• "In infrastructure deployment in Terraform, what kind of infrastructure?"
• "So what is the structure of?" (Referring to the system architecture)
• "So what kind of... you have this?"
• When discussing the tool Cube Marine, the interviewer asked: "What is it called?"
• "Okay but so [you] use Marine to manage?"
• "For GCP also?"
Roles and Responsibilities
• "Apart from deploying, what else do you do?"
• "Apart from deploying what else?" (Reiterated for emphasis)
• The interviewer pushed for specific day-to-day details, noting: "I just wanted to understand what you worked... your day-to-day operations, what you do day-to-day, how you work. That’s what I’m taking."
Problem Solving and Incident Handling
• "Tell me one of the recent issues that you got in your [experience]?"
• "What are the error that [you got]?"
• "Unknown node?" (Clarifying the specific error mentioned)
• "So you are saying node failed because of configuration issue?"
• "How many nodes were there?"
• "I'm just trying to understand how many nodes were there, how many nodes failed, how many nodes were running fine?"


1️⃣ “Just talk to me about your GCP experience.”

Easy answer:

“I’ve been working on Google Cloud mainly for infrastructure and application deployment. I’ve used services like Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Storage, VPC, IAM, and Load Balancers.
Most of my work is around deploying infrastructure using Terraform, managing Kubernetes clusters, and supporting applications running on GCP. I also handle monitoring, troubleshooting, and day-to-day operations.”

2️⃣ “In infrastructure deployment in Terraform, what kind of infrastructure?”

Easy answer:

“Using Terraform, I deploy GCP infrastructure like VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, Compute Engine instances, GKE clusters, service accounts, IAM roles, and load balancers.
We use Terraform to make everything reusable and consistent across environments like dev, QA, and prod.”

3️⃣ “So what is the structure of?” (System architecture)

Easy answer:

“The architecture is mainly based on GKE.
We have applications running as containers inside Kubernetes clusters.
Traffic comes through a load balancer, then goes to the services and pods inside GKE.
The backend services connect to databases or storage, and everything runs inside a secure VPC.”

(If they want simpler)

“It’s a microservices-based architecture running on GKE.”

4️⃣ “So what kind of… you have this?”

(They’re usually checking tools/services)

Safe answer:

“Yes, we have monitoring, logging, CI/CD, and security in place.
We use tools for deployment automation, cluster management, and monitoring to keep the system stable.”

5️⃣ Cube Marine / “What is it called?”

Correct, simple answer:

“It’s called KubeMarine. It’s a Kubernetes cluster management and deployment tool.”

6️⃣ “Okay but so you use Marine to manage?”

Answer:

“Yes, we use KubeMarine to manage Kubernetes clusters.
It helps with cluster provisioning, configuration management, node setup, and upgrades.”

7️⃣ “For GCP also?”

Answer:

“Yes, we use it for Kubernetes clusters running on GCP as well.”

🔹 Roles and Responsibilities
8️⃣ “Apart from deploying, what else do you do?”

Strong, clear answer:

“Apart from deployment, I handle monitoring, troubleshooting, incident support, cluster maintenance, and configuration changes.
I also work on optimizing resources, managing access using IAM, and supporting developers when issues occur.”

9️⃣ “Day-to-day operations – what do you do daily?”

Very important answer (interviewers LOVE this):

“On a daily basis, I monitor the health of applications and clusters, check alerts, handle incidents if any, support deployments, review logs, and troubleshoot issues.
I also work on Terraform changes, Kubernetes configurations, and coordinate with the development team.”

🔥 Problem Solving & Incident Handling
🔟 “Tell me one recent issue you faced.”

Good real-world answer:

“Recently, we faced an issue where one Kubernetes node went into a NotReady state, and pods were getting evicted.”

1️⃣1️⃣ “What error did you get?”

Answer:

“We saw an ‘Unknown node’ or node NotReady error in the cluster.”

1️⃣2️⃣ “Unknown node?”

Answer:

“Yes, the node stopped responding to the control plane, so Kubernetes marked it as Unknown.”

1️⃣3️⃣ “So node failed because of configuration issue?”

Answer:

“Yes, it was mainly due to a configuration issue on the node, which caused the kubelet to stop communicating.”

(You can also say network or disk issue if asked deeper)

1️⃣4️⃣ “How many nodes were there?”

Example answer (adjust numbers if needed):

“The cluster had 5 nodes.”

1️⃣5️⃣ “How many failed and how many were fine?”

Clear answer:

“Out of 5 nodes, 1 node failed and 4 nodes were running fine.
Kubernetes rescheduled the pods to healthy nodes, so application impact was minimal.”

✅ Bonus Interview Closing Line (Very Powerful)

Use this if you want to sound confident:

“Overall, my role is a mix of infrastructure automation, Kubernetes management, and operational support to keep systems stable and reliable.”
