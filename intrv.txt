1️⃣ Pods are restarting frequently – how do you debug?

Answer:
I follow a step-by-step approach:

Check pod status

kubectl get pods


Describe the pod to see events

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>


Check logs

kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous


Common reasons:

Application crash

Liveness probe failing

Out of memory (OOMKilled)

Misconfigured environment variables

If needed, check node resources and limits.

Follow-up Q:
👉 What is OOMKilled?
Answer:
When a container exceeds its memory limit, Kubernetes kills it and restarts the pod.

2️⃣ Difference between Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet
Feature	Deployment	StatefulSet	DaemonSet
Pod identity	Random	Fixed (pod-0, pod-1)	One per node
Storage	Shared	Persistent	Usually not
Use case	Stateless apps	Databases	Monitoring, logging

Examples:

Deployment → Web apps

StatefulSet → MySQL, Kafka

DaemonSet → Fluentd, Node Exporter

Follow-up Q:
👉 Can Deployment be used for databases?
Answer:
Not recommended because pod identity and storage are not stable.

3️⃣ How do rolling updates work in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Rolling updates update pods gradually without downtime.

Old pods are terminated slowly

New pods are created in batches

Controlled by:

maxUnavailable and maxSurge:
maxUnavailable details below
Maximum number of pods that can be down (not available) during an update.
👉 Example:
Replicas = 10
maxUnavailable: 2
→ At most 2 pods can be unavailable while updating

maxSurge
Maximum number of extra pods that can be created above desired replicas during an update.
👉 Example:
Replicas = 10
maxSurge: 3
→ Kubernetes can temporarily run 13 pods

Follow-up Q:
👉 How do you rollback?
Answer:

kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>

4️⃣ Liveness vs Readiness probes
Probe	Purpose
Liveness	Checks if app is alive
Readiness	Checks if app can receive traffic

Key point:

Liveness failure → Pod restarted

Readiness failure → Traffic stopped

Follow-up Q:
👉 Can both be HTTP probes?
Answer:
Yes, HTTP, TCP, or command-based probes.

5️⃣ ClusterIP vs NodePort vs LoadBalancer
Type	Access
ClusterIP	Internal only
NodePort	NodeIP:Port
LoadBalancer	Cloud LB with external IP

Follow-up Q:
👉 Which is best for production?
Answer:
LoadBalancer or Ingress.

6️⃣ How does Kubernetes service load balance traffic?

Answer:

Service uses kube-proxy

Traffic is distributed using iptables or IPVS

Load balances across healthy pod endpoints

Follow-up Q:
👉 Is it round-robin?
Answer:
Yes, effectively round-robin at network level.

7️⃣ Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)

Answer:
PDB ensures minimum availability during:

Node drain

Upgrades

Example:

minAvailable: 2


Follow-up Q:
👉 Does PDB stop manual pod deletion?
Answer:
No, it only affects voluntary disruptions.

8️⃣ Monitoring Kubernetes – tools used

Answer:

Prometheus – metrics

Grafana – dashboards

Alertmanager – alerts

Kubernetes Dashboard

Cloud Monitoring (GCP)

Follow-up Q:
👉 What metrics do you monitor?
Answer:
CPU, memory, pod restarts, latency, error rate.

🔹 Terraform & Infrastructure as Code
9️⃣ Did you work on Terraform?

Answer:
Yes, I used Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure like GCP compute, networking, Kubernetes, and IAM using code.

🔟 Sample Terraform code for GCP

Answer (Explain verbally):

Provider configuration

Resource blocks

Variables and outputs

Remote state

(You don’t need to write full code in interview unless asked)

Follow-up Q:
👉 What is Terraform provider?
Answer:
It’s a plugin that allows Terraform to talk to cloud APIs.

1️⃣1️⃣ Managing Terraform state in production

Answer:

Use remote backend

GCS bucket with:

Versioning

State locking

Never use local state in prod

Follow-up Q:
👉 Why remote state?
Answer:
To avoid conflicts and support team collaboration.

1️⃣2️⃣ Terraform apply failed midway – what do you do?

Answer:

Check state file

Run:

terraform plan


Fix issue and re-apply

Terraform resumes from current state

Follow-up Q:
👉 Does Terraform rollback automatically?
Answer:
No, it is not transactional.

1️⃣3️⃣ Prevent accidental resource deletion

Answer:

Use:

lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}


Enable approvals in CI/CD

Use separate environments

1️⃣4️⃣ Managing secrets in Terraform

Answer:

Use GCP Secret Manager

Use environment variables

Avoid hard-coding secrets

Follow-up Q:
👉 Is Terraform state encrypted?
Answer:
Yes, but secrets can still appear in state.

1️⃣5️⃣ Terraform drift detection

Answer:

Run:

terraform plan


Drift occurs when infra changes outside Terraform

1️⃣6️⃣ Avoid hard-coding values

Answer:

Use variables

Use tfvars files

Use modules

1️⃣7️⃣ Why Terraform recreates resources unexpectedly?

Answer:

Immutable fields changed

Manual infra changes

Provider version mismatch

🔹 GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
1️⃣8️⃣ GCP services worked on

Answer:

GKE

Cloud Run

Compute Engine

Cloud Storage

IAM

VPC

Pub/Sub

Secret Manager

1️⃣9️⃣ Cloud Run experience

Answer:
Yes, used Cloud Run for serverless containerized applications with auto-scaling.

Follow-up Q:
👉 When to use Cloud Run vs GKE?
Answer:
Cloud Run for simple stateless apps, GKE for complex workloads.

2️⃣0️⃣ Reducing GCP costs

Answer:

Autoscaling

Right-sizing

Committed use discounts

Delete unused resources

Use preemptible VMs

2️⃣1️⃣ Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions

Answer:
Yes, created topics and pull/push subscriptions.

2️⃣2️⃣ GCP Secrets

Answer:
Yes, created secrets using Secret Manager.

How to create:

Console

CLI

Terraform

🔹 CI/CD – Jenkins & ArgoCD

Answer:

Define project YAML

Configure:

Repos

Destinations

Permissions

2️⃣7️⃣ ArgoCD app out of sync but manifests same

Answer:
