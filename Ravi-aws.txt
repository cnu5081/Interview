Core Role – AWS Cloud Engineer
Q: “Can you tell me about your core roles and responsibilities as an AWS cloud engineer?”
Answer (Simple & Clear):

My core responsibility as an AWS Cloud Engineer was to design, build, secure, and optimize cloud infrastructure on AWS.
I worked on cost optimization, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, Kubernetes/EKS management, networking, and security.
I also collaborated closely with developers to ensure applications were scalable, highly available, and deployed using automation instead of manual processes.

Key responsibilities I usually mention:


Designing AWS architecture (VPC, EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, IAM)


Cost monitoring and optimization


Building CI/CD pipelines


Writing Terraform modules and managing state


Managing Kubernetes/EKS clusters


Troubleshooting production issues


Improving reliability, security, and automation


Follow-up:
Q: How did you measure success in your role?
A: By reduced cloud cost, faster deployments, fewer production incidents, and higher automation coverage.

2. Cost Management & Optimization
Q: “What were the challenges during cost spikes and how did you face them?”
Answer:

The main challenges were unexpected EC2 usage, over-provisioned resources, unused EBS volumes, NAT Gateway data charges, and non-production environments running 24/7.
To handle this, I first identified the root cause using cost analysis tools, then applied optimization techniques like right-sizing, scheduling, and commitment plans.

Follow-up:
Q: What was the most common cause of cost spikes?
A: Over-provisioned EC2 instances and non-prod environments running continuously.

Q: “What was your approach to troubleshooting cost issues?”
Answer:

I followed a structured approach:



Analyze cost using AWS Cost Explorer


Drill down by service, region, and resource


Identify abnormal usage patterns


Tag resources to identify owners


Take corrective actions like right-sizing, stopping unused resources, or automation


Follow-up:
Q: How quickly were you able to reduce costs?
A: In most cases, immediate savings within days and long-term savings within a month.

Q: “Which FinOps tools have you used?”
Answer:

I have used both AWS native and third-party tools:



AWS Cost Explorer


AWS Budgets & Alerts


AWS Compute Optimizer


Trusted Advisor


CloudWatch metrics


Third-party tools like CloudHealth / Spot.io (if applicable)


Follow-up:
Q: Why use third-party tools when AWS provides native tools?
A: Third-party tools provide better forecasting, dashboards, and multi-account visibility.

Q: “How did you design commitment strategies like Savings Plans or Reserved Instances?”
Answer:

I analyzed 12 months of usage data, identified stable workloads, and applied:



Compute Savings Plans for EC2 and EKS


Reserved Instances for steady RDS workloads
I avoided committing on variable or seasonal workloads.


Follow-up:
Q: Why choose Savings Plans over Reserved Instances?
A: Savings Plans are more flexible across instance families and regions.

Q: “Example of automation that directly reduced cloud cost?”
Answer:

I built an automation using Lambda + EventBridge to:



Stop non-production EC2 and RDS instances after business hours


Start them automatically in the morning
This reduced non-prod cost by nearly 40%.


Follow-up:
Q: How did you avoid impacting production?
A: Using tags like Environment=NonProd and exclusion rules.

3. CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code
Q: “What CI/CD pipelines have you built?”
Answer:

I have built multiple CI/CD pipelines from scratch using GitHub Actions and Jenkins for:



Application deployments


Terraform infrastructure provisioning


Docker image builds and pushes to ECR


Follow-up:
Q: Which one do you prefer? Jenkins or GitHub Actions?
A: GitHub Actions for simplicity; Jenkins for complex enterprise workflows.

Q: “Describe a GitHub Actions to Jenkins pipeline.”
Answer:

GitHub Actions was used for code validation and triggering Jenkins.
Pipeline stages included:



Code checkout


Linting and testing


Docker build


Push image to ECR


Terraform plan & apply


Deploy to EKS


Follow-up:
Q: What were the triggers?
A: Pull requests, merges to main branch, and manual approvals.

Q: “Where do you store Terraform code and state file?”
Answer:

Terraform code is stored in GitHub/GitLab.
State files are stored in:



S3 bucket with versioning


DynamoDB for state locking


Follow-up:
Q: Why remote state?
A: To avoid state corruption and support team collaboration.

Q: “How did you write Terraform modules from scratch?”
Answer:

I created reusable modules for VPC, EKS, EC2, and RDS by:



Defining input variables


Writing resource blocks


Using outputs


Adding validation and defaults



Q: “Explain the Terraform module structure.”
Answer:
module-name/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── versions.tf
└── README.md


Q: “How do you manage source control and IaC deployments?”
Answer:

Using Git branching strategy:



Feature branches


PR reviews


CI pipeline for terraform plan


Manual approval for terraform apply



4. Kubernetes & EKS
Q: “Your experience with Kubernetes and when prefer EKS?”
Answer:

I have hands-on experience managing workloads, deployments, services, HPA, and ingress.
I prefer EKS over self-managed Kubernetes when I need:



Managed control plane


AWS integration


High availability


Reduced operational overhead


Follow-up:
Q: When would you choose self-managed Kubernetes?
A: When cost or deep customization is required.

Q: “How did you migrate worker nodes to EKS?”
Answer:

I created a new EKS node group, drained old nodes using kubectl drain, and allowed pods to reschedule automatically.


Q: “How do you perform OS upgrades on EKS worker nodes?”
Answer:

By creating new node groups with updated AMIs and gradually migrating workloads using rolling upgrades.


Q: “Experience with Cluster Autoscaler or Karpenter?”
Answer:

Yes, I’ve used Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter to automatically scale nodes based on pod requirements.
Karpenter is faster and more flexible.


Q: “Experience with HPA and other scaling mechanisms?”
Answer:

I’ve used:



HPA based on CPU/memory


VPA (limited usage)


Cluster Autoscaler


Karpenter



5. Networking
Q: “How would you connect two VPCs in Singapore and US?”
Answer:

I would use VPC Peering (same region) or Transit Gateway + Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Global Accelerator for cross-region communication.


Q: “What mechanisms would you use?”
Answer:


VPC Peering


Transit Gateway


Site-to-Site VPN


Direct Connect (for low latency)



Q: “How do NAT Gateways and Transit Gateways scale?”
Answer:

NAT Gateways scale automatically within an AZ.
Transit Gateways scale horizontally and support multi-VPC and multi-region architectures.


Final Interview Closer
Q: “Anything else you want to add?”
Answer:

I strongly believe in automation, cost-aware architecture, and building scalable systems.
I focus on reducing manual work, improving reliability, and continuously optimizing cloud usage.
