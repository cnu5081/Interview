6. Jenkins and CI/CD Triggers
Technical questions regarding Jenkins automation included:
• "Have you written any files like declarative or have you got any chance to written this or only you are managing Jenkins and the UI?"
• "What are the credential types supported by Jenkins?"
• "How Jenkins knows when you execute a scheduled job or pipeline? How it is triggered?"
7. Closing and Post-Interview Discussion
The session ended with a formal invitation for questions and a private discussion between the participants:


“What tools are you using?”

Answer:

Git / GitHub / GitLab

Jenkins

Docker

Kubernetes (GKE)

Terraform

ArgoCD

Prometheus & Grafana

GCP services

❓ “How do you manage code?”

Answer:

We use Git-based version control with proper branching strategies like feature, develop, and main branches, and all changes go through pull requests and reviews.

3️⃣ Docker & Architecture
❓ “How is deployment running applications directly from Jenkins?”

Answer:

Jenkins does not deploy applications directly.
Jenkins builds the code, creates Docker images, runs tests, and pushes images to a container registry.
After that, Kubernetes pulls the image and runs the application.

❓ “What is the complete architecture?”

Answer:

Developer pushes code →
Jenkins pipeline builds & tests →
Docker image created →
Image pushed to registry →
ArgoCD syncs Kubernetes manifests →
Kubernetes deploys pods →
Service & LoadBalancer expose the app.

❓ “How are images downloaded and what is Kubernetes’ role?”

Answer:

Kubernetes pulls images from the container registry and manages pod scheduling, scaling, self-healing, and networking.

❓ “What is the structure of a Dockerfile?”

Answer:

A Dockerfile contains instructions to build an image:

FROM

WORKDIR

COPY

RUN

EXPOSE

CMD / ENTRYPOINT

❓ “What is the sequence of Dockerfile commands?”

Answer:

FROM

WORKDIR

COPY

RUN

EXPOSE

CMD / ENTRYPOINT

Follow-up

👉 Difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
Answer:
CMD provides default command; ENTRYPOINT is always executed.

❓ “What other Dockerfile commands?”

Answer:

ENV

ARG

USER

LABEL

VOLUME

❓ “What type of artifacts are used?”

Answer:

Docker images, JAR files, and build artifacts stored in container registries or artifact repositories.

4️⃣ Kubernetes Management & Networking
❓ “How do you manage applications using Kubernetes?”

Answer:

I write YAML manifests for:

Deployments

Services

ConfigMaps

Secrets

HPA

These YAML files define how applications should run.

❓ “Traffic is fluctuating – how do you handle it?”

Answer:

Using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) which scales pods based on CPU or memory usage.

❓ “What is the role of LoadBalancer?”

Answer:

LoadBalancer exposes applications to external traffic and distributes traffic across pods.

❓ “Internal or external traffic?”

Answer:

LoadBalancer is mainly for external traffic.

❓ “What do you write in YAML?”

Answer:

Image name

Replicas

Resource limits

Probes

Ports

Environment variables

❓ “How do you specify replicas?”

Answer:

In Deployment YAML:

replicas: 3

❓ “How rolling updates work?”

Answer:

Kubernetes updates pods gradually without downtime using maxSurge and maxUnavailable.

❓ “Command for rolling update?”

Answer:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

❓ “How do you restrict access to resources?”

Answer:

RBAC

Network Policies

Resource quotas

❓ “Types of Kubernetes services?”

Answer:

ClusterIP

NodePort

LoadBalancer

❓ “Role of NodePort?”

Answer:

Exposes service on a static port on each node.

❓ “How expose one port on each node?”

Answer:

Define type: NodePort and specify nodePort in YAML.

5️⃣ Terraform (IaC)
❓ “Have you used Terraform?”

Answer:
Yes, extensively.

❓ “What have you developed using Terraform?”

terraform validate

terraform plan

terraform apply

terraform destroy

❓ “Command sequence?”

Answer:

init

validate

plan

apply

❓ “What is terraform validate?”

Answer:

It checks syntax and configuration errors.

❓ “How ignore duplicates?”

Answer:

Use count

Use for_each

Proper state management

❓ “What module can you name?”

Answer:

VPC module

GKE module

IAM module

❓ “Multiple users running Terraform?”

Answer:

Use remote backend with state locking.

❓ “Recover manually deleted resource?”

Answer:

Run terraform apply to recreate or terraform import.

❓ “What does terraform plan show?”

Answer:

What will be created, updated, or destroyed.

❓ “Multiple cloud providers?”

Answer:

Define multiple providers and reference them using provider aliases.

6️⃣ Jenkins & CI/CD
